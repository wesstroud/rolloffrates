Literally my only issue was a mix up on the pick up date. But I called and they got it taken care of, it just took a couple of days for the local company to get on it. But the Dumpsters.com people were fantastic. I would recommend highly.  by Michael lauApril 30I have used them for a while! I have been using these people for a few years with my little 2 yard Dumpster and just had them drop off a 30 yard for some clean up. I'm pleased with how both dumpsters are handled. Easy to get easy to pickup and great people to deal with.  by Margaret TlustyApril 23Quick and easy to work with…Our Company works with TJ Stewart from Dumpsters.com, and he always makes sure our Dumpsters are on time and can get communications faster to dispatch than I ever could.
